This program will read any .map file with the same format of the original file. 
And it will give you the path between any two nodes by Dijkstra of Floyd's algorithm and you can compare the results. 
Also the program will paint the graph using GNUPLOT when you exit the program. 

You can choose the nodes by their id or coordinates. 

Some random nodes chosen for testing:

id		lat		lon
